You need to include a valid API key in the Authorization header of each request you make to our API. Each request to our API endpoints must include this authorization header.

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Your API key can be found on the Lonescale App \> Integrations \> Public API

Be sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual API key. Without a valid API key in your request, you will not be able to access the API endpoints and will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.

Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
